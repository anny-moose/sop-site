# Tutorial 2 - Processes, Signals and Descriptors

{{< hint info >}}
This tutorial contains the explanations for the used functions and their parameters.
It is still only a surface-level tutorial and it is **vital that you read the man pages** to familiarize yourself and understand all of the details.
{{< /hint >}}

## Process Management

### Creating Processes
A child process is created using the `fork` command. Let’s take a look at the definition of this function:

```
pid_t fork(void)
```

As you can see, it returns an object of type `pid_t`, which is a signed integer type. In the parent process, the function returns the identifier of the newly created process, while in the child process it returns `0`. This makes it easy to distinguish between the logic executed by the child and the logic executed by the parent.

Of course, creating a new process may fail (for example, when the system runs out of necessary resources). In such a case, the `fork` function returns `-1` and sets the appropriate value of the `errno` variable.

Processes created by a given process are called its __children__, while from the perspective of a child process, the process that created it is called the __parent__.

More information:
```
man 3p fork
```

### Process Identification
Each process has a unique identifier of type `pid_t`. To obtain information about the process identifier, we use the `getpid()` function, and to find out the identifier of the parent process, we use the `getppid()` function. Their definitions are as follows:

```
pid_t getpid(void)
pid_t getppid(void)
```

As you can see, they do not take any arguments and return an object of type `pid_t`.

According to the POSIX standard, both functions __always succeed__ (`man 3p getpid`).

### Exercise

Write a program that creates 'n' sub-processes (n is 1st program parameter), each of those processes waits for random [5-10]s time then prints its PID and terminates. Parent process prints the number of alive child processes every 3s. For now, do not worry about waiting for child processes.

### Solution

<em>solution <b>prog13a.c</b>:</em>
{{< includecode "prog13a.c" >}}

### Notes and questions 

- Make sure you know how the process group is created by shell, what processes belong to it?

- Please note that macro `ERR` was extended with `kill(0, SIGKILL)`, it is meant to terminate the whole program (all other
processes) in case of error.

- Provide zero as pid argument of `kill` and you can send a signal to all the processes in the group. It is very useful not
to keep the PID's list in your program.

- Please notice that we do not test for errors inside of `ERR` macro (during error reporting), it is so to keep the program
action at minimal level at emergency exit. What else can we do ? Call `ERR` recursively and have the same errors again?

- Why after you run this program the command line returns immediately while processes are still working?
{{< details "Answer" >}} Parent process is not waiting for child processes, no wait or waitpid call. It will be fixed in the 2nd stage. {{< /details >}}

- How to check the current parent of the created sub-processes (after the initial parent quits)? Why this process?
{{< details "Answer" >}}  Right after the command line returns run: $ps -f, you should see that the PPID (parent PID) is 1 (init/systemd). It is caused by premature end of parent process, the orphaned processes can not "hang" outside of process three so they have to be attached somewhere. To make it simple, it is not the shell but the first process in the system. {{< /details >}}

- Random number generator seed is set in child process, can it be moved to parent process? Will it affect the program?
{{< details "Answer" >}} Child processes will get the same "random" numbers because they will have the same random seed. Seeding can not be moved to parent. {{< /details >}}

- Can we change the seed from `PID` to `time()` call?
{{< details "Answer" >}} No. Time you get from time() is returned in seconds since 1970, in most cases all sub-processes  will have the same seed and will get the same (not random) numbers. {{< /details >}}

- Try to derive a formula to get random number from the range `[A,B]`, it should be obvious.

- How this program works if you remove the exit call in child code (right after child_work call)?
{{< details "Answer" >}} Child process after exiting the child_work will continue back into forking loop! It will start it's own children. Grandchildren can start their children and so on. To mess it up a bit more child processes do not wait for their children.  {{< /details >}}

- How many processes will be started in above case if you supply 3 as starting parameter?
{{< details "Answer" >}}  1 parent 3 children,  3 grand children and 1 grand grand child, 8 in total, draw a process three for it, tag the branches with current (on `fork`) n value. {{< /details >}}

- What `sleep` returns? Should we react to this value somehow?
{{< details "Answer" >}} It returns the time left to sleep at the moment of interruption by signal handling function. In this code child processes does not receive nor handle the signals so this interruption is not possible.  In other codes it may be vital to restart sleep with remaining time. {{< /details >}}

- In the next stage child waiting and child counting will be added. How can we know how many child processes have exited?
{{< details "Answer" >}} SIGCHLD counting will not be precise as signals can marge, the only sure method is to count successful calls to wait or waitpid. {{< /details >}}

### Waiting for Child Processes
After completing the execution of all its instructions, a child process enters the **zombie** state (its identifier still remains in the process table) and stays in this state until the parent process retrieves information about its status (`Status Information` from `man 3p wait`). Only then are the child process’s resources fully released from the system.

The parent can obtain the status information of a waiting child process using the `wait` function, which waits for any child process, or the `waitpid` function, which allows specifying which particular child process to wait for.
Let’s take a look at their definitions:

```
pid_t wait(int *stat_loc);
pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *stat_loc, int options);
```


As we can see, both functions return a `pid_t` object, which is the identifier of the process whose status we receive information about.

Both functions take the `stat_loc` argument of type `int*`, which points to a memory location where the information about the process’s status will be stored (if we do not need this information, we can pass `NULL`).

The `waitpid` function has two additional arguments: `pid` of type `pid_t` and `options` of type `int`.

The `pid` argument specifies which processes we want to wait for. Depending on its value, the function behaves as follows:  
- `pid == -1` - wait for any child process.
- `pid > 0` - wait for the process with the identifier equal to `pid`.
- `pid == 0` - wait for any process whose group ID is equal to the group ID of the calling process.
- `pid < -1` - wait for any process whose group ID is equal to the absolute value of `pid`.

The `options` argument specifies modifications to the function’s behavior and can be a combination of the following options:  
- `WCONTINUED` - the function should also return information about processes that were resumed after being stopped.
- `WNOHANG` - the `waitpid` function should not block the calling process if none of the processes we are waiting for can immediately report their status. In this case, the function returns `0`. 
- `WUNTRACED` - the function should also return information about processes that were stopped.

For the purposes of the lab, it is enough to know the `WNOHANG` option.

More information:
```
man 3p wait
```

In summary, we can consider the `waitpid` function as a more advanced version of the `wait` function: calling `wait(stat_loc)` is equivalent to calling `waitpid(-1, stat_loc, 0)`.

Of course, both functions may fail, in which case they return `-1` and set the appropriate `errno` value.

__Note:__ If we call `wait` or `waitpid` and the pool of child processes to wait for is empty, the function returns `-1` and sets `errno` to `ECHILD`. It is useful to take advantage of this to ensure that no processes are left orphaned before the parent process terminates.

### Exercise

Extend the program from the previous exercise to correctly wait for child processes.

### Solution

<em>solution <b>prog13b.c</b>:</em>
{{< includecode "prog13b.c" >}}

### Notes and questions

- It is worth knowing that `waitpid` can tell us about temporary lack of terminated children (returns zero) and about permanent lack of them (error `ECHILD`). The second case is not a critical error, your code should expect it.

- Why `waitpid` is in a loop?
{{< details "Answer" >}} we do not know how many zombie processes are there to collect,  it can be from zero to n of them. {{< /details >}}

- Why `waitpid` has the `WNOHANG` flag on?
{{< details "Answer" >}} we do not want to wait for alive child processes as we have to report the counter every 3 sec. to the user {{< /details >}}

- Why zero in place of pid in `waitpid` call?
{{< details "Answer" >}} We want to wait for any child process, we do not need to know children pids, zero means any of them. {{< /details >}}

- Does this program encounter signals? 
{{< details "Answer" >}} Yes - SIGCHILD. there is no handling routine but in this case it's alright, children are handled promptly by the above loop. {{< /details >}}

- Shouldn't we check `sleep` return value as we have signals in this code?
{{< details "Answer" >}} No, as we do not handle them. {{< /details >}}


## Signals

Signals are an asynchronous event-handling mechanism used in Unix-like
operating systems. They allow notifying processes about the occurrence
of specific system events, exceptions, or requests to control execution.

### Sending signals

Signals are sent using the `kill` function:

``` c
#include <signal.h>

int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);
```

The `pid` argument specifies which process or group of processes the
signal is directed to:
 - `pid > 0` - the signal is sent to the process with PID equal to `pid`
 - `pid = 0` - the signal is sent to processes belonging to the sender's process group (the sender also receives the signal)
 - `pid = -1` - the signal is sent to all processes to which the sender has permission (including itself)
 - `pid < -1` - the signal is sent to the processes with **group ID** equal to the absolute value of `pid`

The `sig` argument specifies which signal should be sent. It can take
the following values:
 - one of the macros defined in `<signal.h>`, such as `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`, or `SIGUSR1`. The full list can be found in the manual: 
```bash 
man 7 signal
```
 - value zero - in this case, no signal is sent the function only checks for potential execution errors.

The function returns `0` on success. Otherwise, it returns `-1` and an appropriate value of `errno` is set.

More information:
```bash
man 3p kill
```

### Signal handling

Each signal has a default behavior assigned to it. You can check the
list of signals and their default behavior using:

```
man 7 signal
```

The way a signal is handled can be checked or changed using:

``` c
#include <signal.h>

int sigaction(int sig, const struct sigaction *restrict act, struct sigaction *restrict oact);
```

Arguments:
 - `sig` specifies which signal we are referring to and takes one of the macros from `<signal.h>`.
 - `act` sets a new signal handler if it points to a `sigaction` structure. If it is `NULL`, the handler is not changed.
 - `oact` - if set to `NULL`, this argument is ignored. Otherwise, the structure it points to is set to the old (or current) handler.

According to POSIX, the `sigaction` structure must contain at least the following fields:
 - `void(*) (int) sa_handler` - a pointer to the signal-handling function, or one of the values `SIG_IGN` or `SIG_DFL`. The handler function must accept an int (the code of the signal being handled) and return nothing. The macro `SIG_IGN` means that the signal will be ignored, while `SIG_DFL` selects the default handling behavior for that signal.
 - `sigset_t sa_mask` - the set of signals that will be blocked during execution of the handler
 - `int sa_flags` - flags modifying signal behavior
 - `void(*) (int, siginfo_t *, void *) sa_sigaction` -- pointer to the alternative handler called when `SA_SIGINFO` flag in `sa_mask` is set

The function returns `0` on success or `-1` on error, setting `errno`.

It is worth noting, that child processes created with `fork` inherit the parent's signal-handling settings.

More information:

```bash
man 3p sigaction
```

### Task

The program takes 4 positional parameters (`n`, `k`, `p`, and `r`). It creates `n` child processes. The parent alternately sends `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` to all children in a loop, waiting `k` and `p` seconds respectively. It terminates when all child processes end.

Each child process randomly selects a sleep time between 5 and 10 seconds, then in a loop sleeps and prints **SUCCESS** if the last received signal was `SIGUSR1`, or **FAILURE** if it was `SIGUSR2`. This loop repeats `r` times.

What the student must know:
 - `man 7 signal`
 - `man 3p sigaction`
 - `man 3p nanosleep`
 - `man 3p alarm`
 - `man 3p memset`
 - `man 3p kill`

### Solution

<em>solution <b>prog14.c</b>:</em>
{{< includecode "prog14.c" >}}


To exchange the data between signal handling routine and the main code we must use global variables, please remember that it is an exceptional situation as in general we do not use global variables. Also please remember that global variables are not shared between related processes. It should be obvious but sometimes students get confused.

The type of the global variable `last_signal` is not accidental
moreover, it is the only **SAFE and CORRECT** type. This results from
the asynchronous nature of calling the signal handler function and more
precisely:
 - `volatile` disables compiler optimizations; it's important
that the compiler does not assume the value of the variable is constant,
because its changes do not result from the code and it could turn a
readable loop `while(work)` where `work` is a global variable into
`while(1)` after optimization.
 - `sig_atomic_t` means the largest numerical type that is processed in a single CPU instruction. If we take
a larger numerical type, an interrupt invoked by a signal handler may
disrupt the resulting value even of a simple comparison `a==0`, if the
interruption occurs during the comparison and changes already compared
bytes.

From the above it follows that we do not pass anything between the
handler and the main code besides simple numbers and states.
Additionally, good practice dictates not interrupting the program for
too long, which leaves very few correct, portable, and safe solutions
regarding how to distribute program logic between the main code and the
signal handler. The simplest rule is that handlers should be extremely
short (assignment, variable increment, etc.) and all logic should remain
in the main code.

The `memset` function is sometimes necessary and usually useful when initializing structures whose full layout is not completely known to us. In this case, POSIX explicitly states that the `sigaction` structure may contain more fields than required by the standard. In such a situation, these additional fields—whose values we would not set (here we zero them using `memset`) - may cause different behavior on different systems, or even different behavior between program runs.

Can more than one child process be terminated when handling the
`SIGCHLD` signal?
{{< details "Answer" >}} Yes, signals may coalesce; a child may
terminate during the handling of `SIGCHLD`. Hence the loop in the handler function. {{< /details >}}

Can we expect no terminated child during `SIGCHLD` handling? Look at the
end of main.
{{< details "Answer" >}} Yes, the final `wait` in main may "steal" waiting
zombies, i.e., `wait` may execute before the handler. {{< /details >}}

Remember the possible **CONFLICT** between `sleep` and `alarm` - according
to POSIX, `sleep` may internally use `SIGALRM` and signals cannot be
nested. Therefore code waiting for an alarm never uses `sleep` instead,
you can use `nanosleep` like in the code above.

In sending signals (`kill`), PID zero appears; this allows us not to
know the exact PIDs of child processes but also means that we send a
signal to ourselves!

The placement of setting and blocking signal handlers in this program is
very important. Note how it works and answer the questions below. Always
carefully consider the order of these settings in your program - many
student errors come from this!

Note the `sleep`, why is it in a loop? Can the sleep time be exact?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
`sleep` is interrupted by signal handling, so restart is
necessary. Since `sleep` returns remaining sleep time as seconds,
rounding means that exact timing cannot be achieved after restart.
{{< /details >}}

What is the default disposition of most signals (including `SIGUSR1` and
`SIGUSR2`)?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
To kill the target process; in this program, lack of
a handler, blocking, or ignoring `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` would cause
premature termination.
{{< /details >}}

What is the consequence of the parent process sending
`SIGUSR1`/`SIGUSR2` to the whole process group?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
The parent must react to these signals even though it does not need them thus it ignores them.
{{< /details >}}

What would happen if we did not enable ignoring of `SIGUSR1` and
`SIGUSR2` in the parent?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
The parent would kill itself with the first sent signal.
{{< /details >}}

Can we move the ignoring of these signals after the `create_children`
function? The children do not need ignoring - they get a handler on
start.
{{< details "Answer" >}}
No. It could happen (rarely) that children are created
but not yet started, and CPU time returns to the parent, which sends
them a `SIGUSR1`. On the next CPU allocation for children, they would
first handle the signal and thus terminate!
{{< /details >}}

Can we modify this program so that ignoring `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` is
unnecessary?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
Yes. This specific program can have identical
reactions to these signals in both parent and children, so the handler
can be set before fork.
{{< /details >}}

What happens if we move the handling of `SIGCHLD` after fork?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
If a child dies before we enable the handler, it will stay a "zombie" until
another child terminates. Not a major error, but worth attention.
{{< /details >}}

Is `wait` at the end of main necessary? Parent's work should last at
least as long as the slowest child process.
{{< details "Answer" >}}
Timing in the parent
loop is insufficient; in a loaded system, any delay is possible. Without
`wait`, a race condition appears --- the parent or child may finish
first.
{{< /details >}}


## Waiting for a Signal

Often, when writing programs, we encounter a situation where a process, before performing its work, must be informed that another process has completed its task.  
As you might guess, this problem can be easily solved using __signals__. Inspired by the previous task, we could write logic where our process sleeps in a loop and checks whether the last signal it received is the one it is waiting for. Unfortunately, not only is this solution inelegant, but it is also __incorrect__, it could happen that the signal we are waiting for gets "merged" with another signal, and we would never actually know that our process can start its work.  

Fortunately, the operating system provides tools to solve this problem.

To block the program until it receives a signal, we use the `sigsuspend` function. Let’s look at its definition:

```
int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *sigmask);
```

As we can see, this function returns an `int` value, which is used to report a potential error (in that case, it returns `-1`). It takes an argument `sigmask` of type `const sigset_t *`, which is a pointer to a set of signals that the function will wait for.  

The function works as follows: it sets the signal mask to the one provided in the argument, waits to catch one of these signals, then restores the previous signal mask and resumes the execution of the process.

More information:
```
man 3p sigsuspend
```


### Managing the Signal Mask

A set of signals is called a signal mask. We will store the signal mask as an object of type `sigset_t`. The standard does not specify how this type should be implemented; it can be either an `int` or a structure.  

To modify the signal mask, we use the functions `sigemptyset`, which initializes the mask as an empty set, and `sigaddset`, which adds a signal to the mask.  
Let’s look at their definitions:

```
int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);
int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signo);
```

As we can see, both functions take `set` of type `sigset_t *` as the first argument, which is a pointer to the mask we want to edit.  
The function `sigaddset` additionally takes the `signo` argument, which is the code of the signal that, we want to add to the mask.

Both functions return an `int` value, used to indicate the operation's outcome: on success, they return `0`, and on error, they return `-1` and set the appropriate value of the `errno` variable.

More information:
```
man 3p sigaddset
man 3p sigemptyset
```

### Changing the Signal Mask

Once we have defined a new signal mask, we want it to affect the operation of our process.  
For this purpose, we use the `sigprocmask` function, which determines how the signal mask we defined should affect the current signal mask of the process.  
Let’s look at its definition:
```
int sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *restrict set, sigset_t *restrict oset);
```

As we can see, this function takes the following arguments:  
- `how` of type `int` specifies how the new mask should affect the current mask. Available options are:  
  - `SIG_BLOCK` - the resulting signal mask is the union of the mask pointed to by `set` and the current signal mask (we specify which signals we want to __add__ to the mask).  
  - `SIG_SETMASK` - the resulting signal mask is the signal mask pointed to by `set`.  
  - `SIG_UNBLOCK` - the resulting signal mask is the intersection of the current mask and the complement of the mask pointed to by `set` (we specify which signals we want to __remove__ from the mask).  

- `set` of type `const sigset_t *` is a pointer to the mask we want to use to modify the previous mask.  
- `oset` of type `sigset_t *` is a pointer to an object where we want to save the signal mask before modification.

More information:
```
man 3p pthread_sigmask
```


### Exercise

Write a program that starts one child process, which sends every "m" (parameter) microseconds a `SIGUSR1` signal to the parent. Every
n-th signal is changed to `SIGUSR2`. Parent anticipates `SIGUSR2` and counts the amount of signals received. Child process
also counts the amount of `SIGUSR2` sent. Both processes print out the counted amounts at each signal operation. We reuse
some functions from previous code.

- Glibc signal waiting<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Waiting-for-a-Signal.html#Waiting-for-a-Signal"> here</a>
- man 3p pthread_sigmask (sigprocmask only)
- man 3p sigaddset
- man 3p sigemptyset

### Solution

<em>solution part <b>prog15.c</b>:</em>
{{< includecode "prog15.c" >}}

The program terminates on `SIGINT` (`C-c`)

### Notes and questions 

- Try it with various parameters. The shorter microsecond brake and more frequent `SIGUSER2` the faster growing gap between
counters should be observable. In a moment the difference in numbers will be explained. If you do not observe the shift
between counters let the program run a bit longer - 1 minute should do.

- This code was written to show and explain certain problems, it can be easily improved, please keep this in mind when
reusing the code!

- Please do remember about `getppid` function. I have seen students programs passing parent pid as a parameter to the child
process function.

- Waiting for the signal with `sigsuspend` is a very common technique you must know. It is very well explained on GNU page
linked above. The rule of the thumb is to block the anticipated signal first and for most of the program time. It gets
unblocked at the moment program can wait - at `sigsuspend` call. Now the signal can influence our main code only in well
defined points when it is not processing. It is a great advantage for us to limit the signals to certain moments only.

- When above method is in use you can stop worrying about asynchronous codes, they are now synchronous and you can use
more data types for communication via globals and have longer signal handlers.

- Which counter gets skewed? Parent's or child's?
{{< details "Answer" >}} It must be the slower one, program can not count not sent signals, it can only lose some. Only the receiver can miss some of the signal thus the problem is in the parent process. {{< /details >}}

- Why counters are shifted?
{{< details "Answer" >}} You probably blame signal merging but it has small chance to make any impact. The source of the problem is within sigsuspend as THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT DURING ONE CALL TO IT ONLY ONE SIGNAL WILL BE HANDLED! It is a very common misconception! Right after program executes the handler for SIGUSR2 in the duration of the same sigsuspend it executes the handler for SIGUSR1, global variable gets overwritten and parent process has no chance to count the SIGUSR2!   {{< /details >}}

- How can we run the program to lower `SIGUSR2` merging chances to zero and still observe skewed counter?
{{< details "Answer" >}} Run with short brakes between signals and lots of SIGUSR1 between SIGUSR2. Now SIGUSR2 are very unlikely to merge as signals are separated in time by a lot of SIGUSR1, short brakes between signals rises the chance to have multiple handlers run in one sigsuspend. {{< /details >}}

- Correct the above program to eliminate the above problem.
{{< details "Answer" >}} You can have a dedicated global variable only for SIGUSR2, increasing of the counter of SIGUSR2 can run in handler itself it will eliminate the problem of multiple SIGUSR2 handler call in one sigsuspend. Modify the counter printout and it is ready. {{< /details >}}


## Low-level file operations and signals

In this part of the tutorial, we will begin by showing what problems can arise during file operations while signals are being handled simultaneously, and then we will demonstrate how to deal with them.

### Task

Modify the previous program so that the parent process receives `SIGUSR1` signals sent at a specified interval (parameter `1`) and counts them. Additionally, the main process creates a file with a name given as parameter 4, containing a specified number of blocks of a given size (parameters 2 and 3). The content of the file should come from `/dev/urandom`. Each block should be copied separately, ensuring that the sizes are controlled. After copying a block, print to stderr the number of blocks actually copied and the state of the signal counters.

What the student must know:
- `man 4 urandom`

### Incorrect solution

*file **prog16a.c**:*
{{< includecode "prog16a.c" >}}

{{< hint info >}}
Remember: from `/dev/random` you can obtain truly random bytes but only in small amounts; from `/dev/urandom` the numbers are pseudo-random but available in unlimited quantities.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint info >}}
Whenever memory is allocated in a correct program, it must also be freed!
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint info >}}
The permissions in the `open` function can also be given using constants (`man 3p mknod`). Due to strong tradition among programmers/administrators using octal notation and the ease of searching for such numbers in code, we do not consider this a stylistic error (“magic numbers” in this case are acceptable).
{{< /hint >}}

### Problems

After running the program with parameters `1 20 40 out.txt`, you should observe the following problems:
 - Copying shorter blocks than expected. On my laptop, I never exceed 33,554,431 bytes even though it should be 40 MB, and shorter blocks sometimes occur as well. The reason is that the read operation is interrupted (DURING the transfer) by handling the signal.
 - Possible appearance of the error `fprintf: Interrupted system call` — the signal handler interrupts `fprintf` BEFORE it can display anything.
 - Similar messages may appear for `open` and `close`. This may be difficult to observe in this particular program, but according to POSIX, it is possible.
 - You can see that the parent process counts fewer signals than the child sends. Since the summing happens directly in a non-blocking signal handler, it is easy to guess that signal coalescing is happening — but why is it so strong in this program?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
In this architecture (GNU/Linux), the CPU scheduler blocks the execution of signal handling during larger I/O operations, and during that time signals accumulate.
{{< /details >}}

### Notes and questions

Why does the parent process send `SIGUSR1` to the entire group at the end?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
To terminate the child process.
{{< /details >}}

How can the child process terminate upon receiving `SIGUSR1` if it inherited the handler for this signal?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
Immediately after starting, the child restores the default action for that signal, which ensures the process is killed.
{{< /details >}}

Why doesn’t the parent kill itself with that signal?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
It has the handler installed before it sends the signal to the group.
{{< /details >}}

Can this strategy fail?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
Yes, if the parent finishes its task before the child restores the default disposition for `SIGUSR1`.
{{< /details >}}

Can this be improved? So that the parent always kills the child but does not risk killing itself prematurely?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
Send `SIGUSR2` to the child.
{{< /details >}}

Is this strategy for terminating a child always correct and easy to implement?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
Only if the process being killed has no resources. Otherwise you must implement a handler for the terminating signal, which may not be easy.

Why do we check whether the allocated pointer is `NULL` after a memory allocation?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
The system may be unable to allocate more memory; we must be prepared for this. Failing to check is a very common student mistake.

Couldn’t we make this buffer an automatic variable and avoid the code related to allocation and freeing?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
Stacks on known architectures are not large enough for such huge variables (40 MB in the example). Typically the stack is only a few MB. If our buffer were small (a few KB) then we could do that.

Why are the permissions for the new file set to full (0777)?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
`umask` will reduce the permissions. If we don’t require specific settings, this is a good strategy.

### Solving the problems

During I/O operations, functions can be interrupted by the signal handler. In such a case, the functions return `-1` to indicate an error and set `errno` to `EINTR`. The POSIX standard states that in such a case, the function is interrupted before it achieves anything. Therefore, the correct and recommended response is to restart the function with the same parameters as before.

Manually handling this error can become inconvenient over time (especially when performing many I/O operations). For this reason, we can use the macro `TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY`, which is an extension provided by the GNU C library. [Here](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Interrupted-Primitives.html) you can read more about this function. To use the macros, we first need to define the `_GNU_SOURCE`, which gives us access to this kind of non-standard extensions.

Run the program as before — the errors disappear.

### Notes and questions

What other interruption in the program can the signal handler cause?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
It can interrupt I/O operations or sleeping; these are not reported through `EINTR`. In both cases, handling the event is not trivial.
{{< /details >}}

How do we know which functions can be interrupted before they achieve anything (EINTR)?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
The man pages, in the section about returned errors. It is easy to guess: these are functions that may or must wait before doing anything.
{{< /details >}}

Analyze how bulk_read and bulk_write work. You should know what cases are recognized in those functions, what types of interruption they can handle, how to recognize EOF on the descriptor.

Unlike during L1 lab, during L2 and following labs you have to use these functions (or similar ones) when calling `read` or `write` (because we use signals now).
If you do not use them, you wont get points for your solution.

Both `bulk_` functions are useful not only when dealing with signal handling or large I/O transfers, but also in situations where data is not available continuously — pipes/FIFOs/sockets - it will be covered by following tutorials.

All similar functions behave like `read`/`write`: `fread`/`fwrite`, `send`/`recv`.

As you know `SA_RESTART` flag can cause automatic restarts on delivery of a signal if this flag is set in the handler, it
may not be apparent but this method has a lot of shortcomings:
 - You must control all the signal handlers used in the code, they all must be set with this flag, if one does not use this
flag then you must handle EINTR as usual. It is easy to forget about this requirement if you extend/reuse the older
code.
 - If you try to make some library functions (like bulk_read and write) you can not assume anything about the signals in
the caller code.
- It is hard to reuse a code depending on `SA_RESTART` flag, it can only be transferred to the similar strict handler
control code.
- Sometimes we want interruption notifications (e.g., `sigsuspend` loses meaning with `SA_RESTART`).

Why do we not check for errors other than `EINTR` after calling `fprintf`?
{{< details "Answer" >}}
If we cannot write to stderr (usually the screen), then reporting an error is pointless.
{{< /details >}}

Really big (f)printfs can get interrupted in the middle of the process (like write). Then it is difficult to restart the
process especially if formatting is complicated. Avoid using printf where restarting would be critical (most cases
except for the screen output) and the volume of transferred data is significant, use write instead.


## Example tasks

Do the example tasks. During the laboratory you will have more time and a starting code. If you do following tasks in the allotted time, it means that you are well-prepared.

- [Task 1]({{< ref "/sop1/lab/l2/example1" >}}) ~75 minutes
- [Task 2]({{< ref "/sop1/lab/l2/example2" >}}) ~120 minutes
- [Task 3]({{< ref "/sop1/lab/l2/example3" >}}) ~120 minutes

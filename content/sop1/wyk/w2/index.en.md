# Lecture 2 - Processes

## Scope

- Process concept. Process models: UNIX (POSIX), MSWin (Win32).
- Diagram of process state.
- Process Control Block. Process context. Switching CPU between processes.
- Scheduling Queues. Schedulers: short-term, long-term, medium-term.
- Process creation: Models: POSIX, Win32.
- Process termination. POSIX: role of wait(), orphan, zombie.
- Run-time POSIX process environment: environment variables, 3 initial streams (stdin, stdout, stderr). The startup module (`crt0`)
- POSIX process life-cycle
- Inheritance across `fork` and `exec` system calls
- C library function packaging of the `exec` system call.
- Process ids: PID, GID, real/effective ids. setuid/setgid.
- Process groups
- Login shell process creation.

2. Slides: [Processes.pdf]({{< resource "Processes_0.pdf" >}}), [POSIX\_processes.pdf]({{< resource "POSIX-processes_5.pdf" >}})
3. Section 26 of the GNU C library documentation: [Processes](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Processes.html#Processes)
4. [Archive](../../../../common_src1/processes/S2.zip) of programs, that were used during lecture for experimentation. Note that the code is to expose interesting features of POSIX system and C library functions and not to give examples of good programming practices. The code is intended as a reminder of activities performed during a lecture. Perhaps it might stimulate further experimentation. Do not forget to share interesting results with the lecturer.

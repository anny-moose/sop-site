# Recommendations or restrictions on student participation in a course resulting from the required sequence in which the courses should be followed in line with the study plan, and prerequisites

Participation in the Operating Systems 1 course requires passing the courses: Programming 1, Programming 2, Computer Architecture, and Unix System Fundamentals. The student must be able to write and understand programs in the C language.

# Regulations on student mandatory attendance at courses for which attendance is obligatory, including the allowable limit of non-attendance and justification of non-attendance

- Attendance at lectures is not mandatory, but recommended due to the close connection of the discussed material with the laboratory.
- Attendance at graded laboratory classes is mandatory. In case of absence from classes, the student receives 0 points for activities carried out during the classes from which they were absent.
- Absence from two of the laboratory classes graded L1/L2/L3/L4 results in failing the course.

# Detailed methods of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement (e.g., the number of tests) and types of materials and devices approved for use by students during verification of learning outcomes achievement

The course consists of lectures and laboratories.

The laboratory consists of non-graded classes (W1, W2 and W3), graded classes (L1, L2, L3 and L4) and a project. Classes are held according to the schedule provided on the course website. The course website also contains preparatory materials for the classes.

### Graded laboratories
  - Classes L1, L2, L3 and L4 are used to assess skills in the area indicated in the course schedule. For each class, students should prepare independently, using the materials on the course website and lecture materials.
  - You can get from 0 to 22 points for the task
  - The time to complete the task is 130 minutes
  - Laboratory tasks are solved using the Arch Linux system on computers in the laboratory. It is not allowed to solve tasks on student's own computer.
  - The programming task is divided into stages. The points for each stage are given in the task description. The stages must be performed in the specified order. You are not allowed to proceed to the next stage without completing the previous ones.
  - Each stage is checked and assessed during the classes. The assessment covers the ability to use appropriate tools and the correct (including POSIX-compliant) implementation of the required functionality.
  - After completing each stage, students submit their solution to the server using the git version control system, as described at W1. Submissions are subject to the following rules:
    - The program must be written in C (not C++).
    - The solution cannot be submitted more often than once a minute.
    - Only the solution files can be modified.
    - Files must be formatted according to the `clang-format` configuration in the task's starter repository (the tool is available on lab computers and its usage is explained during W1).
    - The program must compile without any errors or warnings using the provided makefile.
  - If a solution does not meet one of these conditions, it is rejected, and the student receives feedback on the issue. Submitting the solution to the server is a prerequisite for grading a given stage; unsent solutions will not be graded.
  - During the solving of programming tasks, students **can** use the course website, their own materials, solutions to sample tasks, system documentation and the Internet, but in such a way that the submitted solution is their independent work. In particular, communication with others and the use of AI-based solutions, such as ChatGPT, Github Copilot and similar, is not allowed.

Class W1 is dedicated to environment setup. During this class, students will configure their programming environment and review skills from the "Unix System Fundamentals" course. Any shortcomings in the environment configuration or these skills (e.g., lack of function name completion, error highlighting in the editor, or inability to navigate directories) will not be considered as mitigating circumstances for grading in subsequent classes. Additionally, during W1, teachers will familiarize students with the solution submission process for the labs.

### Project

The project is completed according to the schedule on the course website. It involves creating a larger program and discussing its implementation with the teacher. The same materials are allowed as in the laboratories. The project is worth up to 12 points.


# Schedule of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement, in particular the dates of written and oral tests and deadlines for submission of reports on completed laboratory work and projects, including make-up dates, if the specifics of the course allow for it

The schedule is available on the course website: sop.mini.pw.edu.pl


# Possibility and rules for students’ participation in tests and examinations held on additional dates

Additional exam dates beyond the number required by the study regulations will not be organized.

# Rules for awarding course credit and the final course grade

- To pass the course, it is necessary to obtain a total of at least 50 points (out of 100 possible), subject to the permissible number of absences.
- The grade from the retake replaces the grade from the retaken classes.
- **The final grade for the course** is the sum of the points obtained by the student from the laboratory:
  - Grade 5.0 - score in the range [90, 100]
  - Grade 4.5 - score in the range [80, 90)
  - Grade 4.0 - score in the range [70, 80)
  - Grade 3.5 - score in the range [60, 70)
  - Grade 3.0 - score in the range [50, 60)
  - Grade 2.0 - score in the range [0, 50)


# Dates and methods of providing information on the results of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement and grades awarded to students

The results of the laboratories are entered into USOS immediately after each class. The results of the project are entered immediately after it is checked during the classes designated for this purpose.

- Partial grades
  - The number of points obtained for subsequent stages of the laboratory task is given at the time of checking by the instructor and written down on the sheet with the task description
  - Points from the laboratory are placed in USOS no later than 24 hours after the classes. The number of points entered in USOS determines the final grade
  - The results of the project are entered immediately after it is checked during the classes designated for this purpose.
- Final grade
  - Issued in USOS within 24 hours of the publication of the results of the last L4 laboratory in USOS
  - Corrected during the examination session within 24 hours of the publication of the results of the make-up laboratory in USOS


# The rules for improving the results of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement and grades awarded to students

At the end of the semester, a retake is organized, during which students can improve the grade obtained in one of the graded laboratories. Registration for the retake will be launched immediately after the last laboratory classes in the semester and will last **24 hours**.

# The rules for retaking particular types of classes included in the course due to unsatisfactory academic progress

A person who has not passed the course must repeat the entire course and take all the assessments. It is not possible to transfer partial points from previous semesters.
